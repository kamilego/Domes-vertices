# Domes-vertices
Script that generates domes vertices with set radius and height.  
Used library os, math, re 
Used python 3.8 and SOFiSTiK Teddy 2020.
I was working on it since October 2020 with a lot of version to solve the engineering problem.

This is a big part of my masters thisis where I had to compare domes including their forces and displacements under the influence of external forces.  
At the beginning my goal was to work with excel program and AutoCAD. However I figured out better way to find a solution.  
Script is the only one utility to create domes files. Main destination was to get .dat files that are extention of SOFiSTiK teddy and generates domes constructions.  
Using python I got many files with certain modified domes. User can input by hand important data like: height, material, cross sections and loads. In effect user gets ready to work teddy files ready to analyze.  
Folders with files are created in the same place were script is saved.  

The biggest adventage? You can create certain dome with specific height and radius. It saves a lot of time.  
In my opinion script is more stable than other FEM programs like Autodesk ROBOT.  

# To use sript
Download script, set paremeters by your own and run it.  
Modified files in right named folders will appear.
